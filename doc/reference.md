##  `MILONGA_PROBLEM`

Defines the number of spatial dimensions and groups of neutron energies.      
It also selects the formulation of the neutronic problem to be solved (i.e. diffusion or tranport)
and the spatial discretization scheme (i.e. finite volumes or finite elements).
If several meshes are defined, it selects over which one it is that the neutronic problem is solved.

# Variables

##  `eigen_error_estimate`

Absolute error estimate $|\lambda - \lambda_\text{real}|$ (`|lambda - lambda_real|`)
of the obtained eigenvalue.



##  `eigen_rel_error`

Relative error $|R \phi - \lambda F \phi|_2/|\lambda \phi|_2$ `|Rx-lFx|_2/|kx|_2`
reached by the eigensolver.



##  `eigen_rel_tolerance`

Tolerance passed the iterative eigensolver, relative to the matrices norm.
By default it is zero, meaning the default value of the SLEPc library.



##  `eigen_residual_norm`

Residual norm $|R \phi - \lambda F \phi|_2$ (`|Rx-lFx|_2`)
reached by the eigensolver.



##  `keff`

Efective multiplication factor as computed by solving the
multigroup neutron diffusion equation. It is equal to 1.0 until
`MILONGA_STEP` is executed.  



##  `memory_usage_global`

Maximum resident set size (global memory used), in bytes.



##  `memory_usage_petsc`

Maximum resident set size (memory used by PETSc), in bytes.



##  `memory_use`

Total available memory, in bytes.



##  `petsc_flops`

Number of floating point operations performed by PETSc/SLEPc.



##  `power`

Power setpoint used to normalize the computed fluxes.
By default it is zero, meaning the fluxes are normalized so
the mean value is equal to one. If this variable is set,
then the property `eSigmaF` should be nonzero through the domain.



##  `sn_a_weight`

Factor used to control the upwinding of the discrete ordinates~$S_N$ formulation.
For the finite volumes scheme, the difference factor $a = 1/2 (1+\alpha)$ is used to weight the adjacent cell fluxes,
i.e. $\alpha = 0$ ($a=1/2$) corresponds to diamond difference
 and $\alpha = 1$ ($a=1$) corresponds to full upwinding.
For the finite elements scheme, a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin stabilization term
$1/2 \alpha \ell/\| \vec{\Omega} \cdot ( \vec{\Omega} \cdot \nabla h)\|$ is added to the weighting functions.
A value of~$\alpha=0$ corresponds to the unstable original Galerkin scheme and
           $\alpha=1$ to the cotangent-optimum upwind term.
For~$\alpha < 1$ expect oscillations in the fluxes and even non-convergence for small values of~$\alpha$.
Default is $\alpha=0.5$.

CPU time insumed to initialize, build and solve, in seconds.
CPU time insumed by PETSc to initialize, build and solve, in seconds.



##  `unknowns`

Number of total unknowns (size) of the problem. It is equal
to the number of spatial unknowns times the number of energy groups.
